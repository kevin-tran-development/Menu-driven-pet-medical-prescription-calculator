A menu driven pet medical prescription calculator by taking in the users pet's information

This project focuses on using the main method and creating an instance with two different methods inside with the pet class containing fully-implemented properties.

* Purpose: To create a menu driven program that calculates the doses of medicated prescription for the user's pets by taking in their pets information such as name, age, weight, and either a dog or cat.
* 
* Input: Name of the pet, age, weight, and either a dog or cat.
* 
* Process: By using the formula for dosage in ml, weight divided by 2.205 multiplied by mg per kg divided by mg per ml, we can use that to calculate the correct dosage of medication for either pain killer, sedative, or both for the user's pet.
* 
* Output: The dosage requirement for either pain killer (carprofen), sedative (acepromazine), or both.
